While our generator covers most basic things, you should add different stuff to your files. To do that, you can modify the templates we use:

## Modifying Filament Templates

Our Filament file templates are in the `systems/generators/filament3/src/templates` directory.

You can modify the files in that directory to change the generated code.

**Note:** Sometimes, you might need to modify the generators themselves. Search for the file name in the `systems/generators/filament3/src/Generators` directory and modify the file.

## Modifying Laravel Templates

Our Laravel file templates are in the `systems/generators/laravel11/src/templates` directory.

As with Filament, you can modify the files in that directory to change the generated code.

**Note:** Sometimes, you might need to modify the generators themselves. Search for the file name in the `systems/generators/laravel11/src/Generators` directory and modify the file.

File templates are written in Blade, so you can use all its features.
